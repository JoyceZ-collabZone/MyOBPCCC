# MyOBPCCC
repo for my banking products comparator
I will need to use technologies I have learned in the last few weeks, including
1) native web technologies: javascript, css, html
2) libraries: jquery, ajax, bootstrape

The app will provide CCC capabilities:
1) check compliance of big 4 banks
2) compare the product rate
3) future scope, competition, offerings for customer
