# MyOBPCCC

repo for my banking products comparator
I will need to use technologies I have learned in the last few weeks, including

1. native web technologies: javascript, css, html
2. libraries: jquery, ajax, bootstrape

The app will provide CCC capabilities:
<<<<<<< HEAD

1. check compliance of big 4 banks
2. compare the product rate
3. future scope, competition, offerings for customer

Please note, the endpoints being called from my app, do not have CORS enabled.
web security needs to be disabled for calling the endpoints.

open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security

linux:
google-chrome --disable-web-security
